{"name":"Pkg-cacher","tagline":"This is a transparent cache for Debian and RedHat packages (.deb and .rpm).  It is based on apt-cacher available on Debian. It has been enhanced to handle RedHat repositories and files whose names are the same but the contents are different.","body":"pkg-cacher for Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS, Fedora and OpenSUSE\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\t\r\n\tThe cache directory structure is incompatible with apt-cacher \r\n\tand apt-proxy.  Unfortunately there isn't enough information\r\n\tavailable in the old directory structure so conversion of the\r\n\tserver isn't possible.\r\n\r\n\tIt should be possible to use pkg-cacher without reconfiguring\r\n\texisting apt-cacher (if path_map was used) or apt-proxy clients \r\n\talthough this hasn't been tested.\r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n\r\nThis program was originally written by Nick Andrews <nick@zeta.org.au>.\r\n\r\nUntil version 0.6-1, the cache directory was left behind on uninstallation:\r\nhowever, that behaviour has now been changed so that the cache dir is left on\r\nupgrade, but deleted on uninstallation. The cache dir can become very large so\r\nit needs to be deleted when the program is no longer required, but to maintain\r\ncache efficiency it needs to be retained on upgrade.\r\n\r\nIn April/May 2005, the main script has been partially rewritten by Eduard\r\nBloch. It was converted to use separate files for package contents (read: the\r\nreal DEBs) and the HTTP headers. Also time stamping for meta files has been\r\nintroduced and curl was chosen as the default fetcher application.  Also the\r\nusage of alternative HTTP daemons has been allowed.\r\n\r\n -- Mark Hindley <mark@hindley.org.uk>, Thu, 20 Mar 2008 20:11:38 z\r\n\r\nLarge parts have been rewritten to support multiple distributions and new\r\nfeatures. The original version of this file has been renamed README.Debian-old.\r\n\r\nTo see a complete list of changes view the changelog file.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is provided in the man page.\r\n\r\n -- Robert Nelson <robertn@the-nelsons.org>, Sun, 09 Nov 2008 12:41:59 -0800\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
